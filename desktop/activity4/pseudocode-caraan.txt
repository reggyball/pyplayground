PROGRAM PIcalcu:

START

//OBTAIN USER INPUT 
// n = determines how many times loop will run and no. of terms to be computed/printed

ASK for user input of (n)
SET initial value of (k) to 3
PRINT intro of values

//LOOP n no. of times to compute for the decimals
START LOOP
    INITIALIZE counter to 1
    SET condition (iterate while counter <= n)
        PRINT current counter value and corresponding value of (k)
        SET value of coefficient (j) to 2x the current value of counter
        COMPUTE for the denominator (x)
        UPDATE the value of (k), k + computed decimal or 4/x
        UPDATE counter +1
        CHECK condition, IF True then repeat loop,otherwise exit loop
END LOOP
